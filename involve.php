			<h3>How do I get involved?</h3>
			<p>AAA holds many events over the semester, from fun social events and 
				informal mixers, to educational discussions and service activities. 
				We encourage you to check our our Facebook page, follow us on twitter, 
				join our mailing list, and come out to our events!</p>
			<h3>What is SibfAAAmily?</h3>
			<p>fAAAmily is our sib family program. We pair underclassmen with 
				upperclassmen to form families who get together for meals, movies, 
				games, or general fun. Big sibs are older students who are mentors to 
				little sibs, answering questions from academics to extracurriculars, or 
				just to give advice on where to get the best bubble tea in Boston.</p>
			<h3>I love AAA! How can I do more?</h3>
			<p>Join board! Every year we elect a new board, and we welcome you to join us. 
				Applications and more information will be available here in December. 
				For now, we welcome you to contribute to our community blog and 
				come to our events!</p>
