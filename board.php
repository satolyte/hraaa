			<h3>Diana Nguyen</h3>My name is Diana Nguyen and I am from Lawndale, California. I am a sophomore living in Quincy house and concentrating in government. I can often be found listening to NPR, eating yogurt with honey, or sipping on tea. I am very excited to serve as the co-president of the Harvard Radcliffe Asian American Association! My freshman year I was the frosh rep and during my sophomore year I was the education/political chair. I look forward to AAA moving into new uncharted territories and into engaging conservations regarding the Asian American Identity.

			<h3>Helen Zhao</h3>Hi everyone! My name is Helen and I'm a sophomore in Pforzheimer House concentrating in Psychology. Although my parents moved to upstate New York after I started college, I still consider myself a true Boston girl. When I am not spending time with my amazing fAAAmily, you can find me dancing with various dance groups on campus or working with the sassy Cambridge kids of CityStep. I fell in love with the Asian American Association my freshman year and am excited to work with this year's board to bring AAA to even greater heights!
